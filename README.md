# Get To Know Me

Hi there! My name is Sean Peliter and I am a Junior Web Developer that currently resides in Columbus, Ohio.

I was a Senior Data Analyst for over 2 years, but have since decided to focus my attention towards my passion, which is web development and design.

When I'm not learning on how to better myself and my work for my clients, I am playing table top games with my friends, going to concerts and discovering new music, looking to add to my vinyl record collection, listening to podcasts and watching any and all horror movies.

You can follow along on my journey to create a website where us horror fanatics get together and share their love for all things horror at [Link](https://itsahorrorblelife.com)

Also, feel free to check out my other passion at [Link](https://dailyalbumreview.com) in the near future. 

Thanks! 

Sean Peltier
